## Course Expectations & Grading
This course aims at the development of three capabilities, i.e. understanding of the concepts, comparison of appropriate security solutions, and mastering of basic operations.
- Quizzes (25%) – A set of quizzes on understanding of basic concepts and technologies. All the quizzes require written answers by individual students in class. No computational aids and Internet access are allowed.
- Homework (50%) – A set of assignments to be fulfilled individually or in groups as specified. These assignments include answers to questions, reading papers, problem solving, as well as exercises that may require hands-on interaction with computers. Only typed or electronic reports (hand drawing okay for figures if necessary and legible) are allowed for homework and term project.
- Class Project (25%) – A few reports (proposal/review/report) to be developed on selected security topics/issues and solutions, by student teams of up to three members. The project includes presentations in class. Detailed class project guidelines will be given out.

A letter grade will be assigned according to this formula: A - 85% and above; B - 70% to 84%; C - 60% to 69%; D - 50% to 59%; F - less than 50%. Appropriate upward curving will be made as necessary.

## Ethics
The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by the Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy:
Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required by the assignment.
If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who participated.
Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs, as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.
On every exam, you will have to agree to the following pledge: "I agree to complete this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or device." Your course instructors will let you know where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.

__In addition, the specific ethics guidelines for this course are:
(1) Be regular; do not fall behind on class materials. No make-up assignments will be offered. If you should be late on an assignment, please obtain prior arrangement with the instructor.
(2) Collaboration is not allowed for individual assignments and exams. Discussion and collaboration is encouraged in team-based assignments in which every student is expected to contribute equally.
(3) Highly ethical behavior is expected when using computing tools and techniques especially when working at on-campus or remote computing facilities.__

Report any violations you witness to the instructor.
